# What is Wire?

Wire is a tool to deploy NixOS systems. Its configuration is a superset[^1] of [colmena](https://colmena.cli.rs/), however it is **not** a fork.

[^1]: Any colmena configuration will continue to work with wire, but wire has additional ergonomic changes you can take advantage of.

::: warning
Wire is alpha software, please use at your own risk. Many features listed in this documentation may not be complete / implemented.

[^2]: You need to write custom nix code to use Colmena hive metadata inside environments like CI pipelines, bash scripting, etc., which requires a knowledge of its internals.
