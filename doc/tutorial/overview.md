# {{ $frontmatter.title }}

wire is a tool to deploy NixOS systems. Its usage is inspired by [colmena](https://colmena.cli.rs/). In many places it's configuration attempts to remain a superset[^1] of colmena, however it is **not** a fork.

[^1]: A lot of your colmena module options will continue to work with wire, but wire has additional ergonomic changes you can take advantage of.

::: warning
wire is alpha software, please use at your own risk. Many features listed in this documentation overall may not be complete / implemented, however features covered in this this tutorial are considered complete.

In this tutorial we will create and deploy a wire Hive. Along the way we will
encounter [npins](https://github.com/andir/npins), simple NixOS
configurations, virutal machines, and deployment keys.

[^2]: You need to write custom nix code to use Colmena hive metadata inside environments like CI pipelines, bash scripting, etc., which requires a knowledge of its internals. Recently it agained the [eval feature](https://colmena.cli.rs/unstable/features/eval.html) which has improved the situation since wire was first started.

[^3]: See https://github.com/zhaofengli/colmena/issues/120

[^4]: wire lacks an equivalent to `colmena exec`.

### Speed

wire is about >2x faster than colmena deploying [identical large
hives](https://github.com/mrshmllow/wire/blob/trunk/bench/run.nix).
