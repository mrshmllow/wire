All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased] - yyyy-mm-dd

### Added

- `--handle-unreachable` arg was added. You can use `--handle-unreachable ignore` to
  ignore unreachable nodes in the status of the deployment.
- A basic progress bar

### Changed

- Reverted "Wire will now attempt to use SSH ControlMaster by default."
- `show` subcommand looks nicer now.
- `build` step will always build remotely when the node is going to be applied
  locally.

## [v1.0.0-alpha.0] - 2025-10-22

### Added

- `--ssh-accept-host` was added.
- `--on -` will now read additional apply targets from stdin.
- `{key.name}-key.{path,service}` systemd units where added.
- `--path` now supports flakerefs (`github:foo/bar`, `git+file:///...`,
  `https://.../main.tar.gz`, etc).
- `--flake` is now an alias for `--path`.
- Wire will now attempt to use SSH ControlMaster by default.
- A terminal bell will be output if a sudo / ssh prompt is ever printed.

### Fixed

- Fix bug where `--non-interactive` was inversed
- `./result` links where being created. they will not be created anymore
- Logging from interactive commands (absence of `--non-interactive`) was
  improved.
- Passing `sources.nixpkgs` directly from npins to `meta.nixpkgs` has
  been fixed.

### Changed

- Logs with level `tracing_level::TRACE` are compiled out of release builds
- Data integrity of keys have been greatly improved
- Unknown SSH keys will be immediately rejected unless `--ssh-accept-host` is passed.
- Logging was improved.
- `config.nixpkgs.flake.source` is now set by default if `meta.nixpkgs` ends
  with `-source` at priority 1000 (default).
- Evaluation has been sped up by doing it in parallel with other steps until
  the .drv is required
- A node which is going to be applied locally will now never `push` or
  `cleanup`.

### Documented

- Added a real tutorial, and separated many how-to guides.
  The tutorial leads the user through creating and deploying a wire Hive.

## [0.5.0] - 2025-09-18

### Added

- Added `--reboot`. wire will wait for the node to reconnect after rebooting.
  wire will refuse to reboot localhost. Keys post-activation will be applied
  after rebooting!
- Most errors now have error codes and documentation links.
- Added the global flag `--non-interactive`.
- wire now creates its own PTY to interface with openssh's PTY to allow for
  interactive sudo authentication on both remote and local targets.

  Using a wheel user as `deployment.target.user` is no longer necessary
  (if you like entering your password a lot).

  A non-wheel user combined with `--non-interactive` will likely fail.

- Added `deployment.keys.environment` to give key commands environment variables.

### Changed

- `wire inspect/show --json` will no longer use a pretty print.
- wire will now wait for the node to reconnect if activation failed (excluding
  dry-activate).
- Nix logs with the `Talkative` and `Chatty` level have been moved to
  `tracing_level::TRACE`.
- Error messages have been greatly improved.

### Fixed

- Some bugs to do with step execution were fixed.

## [0.4.0] - 2025-07-10

### Added

- Nodes may now fail without stopping the entire hive from continuing. A summary
  of errors will be presented at the end of the apply process.
- wire will now ping the node before it proceeds executing.
- wire will now properly respect `deployment.target.hosts`.
- wire will now attempt each target host in order until a valid one is found.

### Changed

- wire now directly evaluates your hive instead of shipping extra nix code along with its binary.
  You must now use `outputs.makeHive { ... }` instead of a raw attribute.
  This can be obtained with npins or a flake input.
- The expected flake output name has changed from `outputs.colmena` to `outputs.wire`.

## [0.3.0] - 2025-06-20

### Added

- Run tests against `unstable` and `25.05` by @mrshmllow in https://github.com/wires-org/wire/pull/176.

### Changed

- Dependency Updates.
- wire now compiles and includes key agents for multiple architectures, currently only linux.
- There is a new package output, `wire-small`, for testing purposes.
  It only compiles the key agent for the host that builds `wire-small`.
- `--no-progress` now defaults to true if stdin does not refer to a tty (unix pipelines, in CI).
- Added an error for the internal hive evaluation parse failure.
- The `inspect` command now has `show` as an alias.
- Remove `log` command as there are currently no plans to implement the feature
- The `completions` command is now hidden from the help page

### Fixed

- A non-existent key owner user/group would not default to gid/uid `0`.
- Keys can now be deployed to localhost.

## [0.2.0] - 2025-04-21

### Added

- Getting Started Guide by @mrshmllow.
- Web documentation for various features by @mrshmllow.
- Initial NixOS VM Testing Framework by @itslychee in https://github.com/wires-org/wire/pull/93.

### Changed

- `runtime/evaluate.nix`: force system to be null by @itslychee in https://github.com/wires-org/wire/pull/84.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> You will have to update your nodes to include `nixpkgs.hostPlatform = "<ARCH>";`

- GH Workflows, Formatting, and other DevOps yak shaving.
- Issue Templates.
- Cargo Dependency Updates.
- `doc/` Dependency Updates.
- `flake.nix` Input Updates.

### Fixed

- Keys with a path source will now be correctly parsed as `path` instead
  of `string` by @mrshmllow in https://github.com/wires-org/wire/pull/131.
- `deployment.keys.<name>.destDir` will be automatically created if it
  does not exist. Nothing about it other than existence is guaranteed. By
  @mrshmllow in https://github.com/wires-org/wire/pull/131.
